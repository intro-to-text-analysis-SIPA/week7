# Week 5: Principles of data analysis: Data wrangling, cleaning, analysis, and visualization with the Pandas and Plotly Libraries

This week, we will review the principles of data wrangling, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Wrangling is the process of transforming data from a raw format into one that is legible. Cleaning entails making sure our data does not include inconsistencies such as duplicate entries or information stored in the wrong format. Analysis and visualizations are ways of telling a story with the data, and uncovering insights that may lead to new research questions. 

We will be using the Pandas and Plotly Python libraries to help us achieve our data processing goals. You can think of a Python library like software that works specifically for Python. Just like you might use Microsoft Excel for data exploration on your personal computer, in Python we have libraries like Pandas and Plotly that we can download and then import (a fancy word for open) in our Python environment. Pandas, which stands for "Python Data Analysis Library", is specifically designed for data manipulation and analysis. Plotly is a data visualization library. 

- Topics covered:
    - Working with tabular data (a.k.a., spreadsheets)
    - The data process: wrangling, cleaning, analysis, and visualization
    - Pandas basics
    - Plotly basics
- Curriculum for this session:
    - Rebecca Krisel's [intro-pandas-dri-2022](https://github.com/rskrisel/intro-pandas-dri-2022)

- Assignments (due by 10am on the day of class):
    - Work through the curriculum for the upcoming week's session in a Jupyter Notebook. Download your Jupyter Notebook as "ipynb" file (Go to "File", "Download as", "Notebook (.ipynb)"), and [upload](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) the file to the weekly GitHub assignment link.
        -  You are welcome to use the dataset provided in the curriculum link or use a dataset of your choice.
