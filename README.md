# Week 7: Data collection: Web scraping with the Beautiful Soup library

This week, we will use the Beautiful Soup Python library for web scraping. Web scraping is the process of extracting content and data from a website using a programming language. In this case, we will web scrape to extract text from websites. 

- Topics covered: 
    - What is web scraping?
    - What are the laws and ethics governing web scraping?
    - How to web scrape?
- Curriculum for this session:
    - Melanie Walsh, _Introduction to Cultural Analytics_, [Web Scraping](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/04-Data-Collection/02-Web-Scraping-Part1.html) parts [I](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/04-Data-Collection/02-Web-Scraping-Part1.html) & [II](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/04-Data-Collection/03-Web-Scraping-Part2.html)
- Assignments (due by 10am on the day of class):
    - Work through the curriculum for the upcoming week's session in a Jupyter Notebook. Download your Jupyter Notebook as "ipynb" file (Go to "File", "Download as", "Notebook (.ipynb)"), and [upload](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) the file to the weekly GitHub assignment link.
        -  You are welcome to use the dataset provided in the curriculum link or use a dataset of your choice. 
- Looking ahead:
    - In week 9, we will work with the Twitter API. It can take a few weeks to get approved for a researcher account, so I suggest getting started now. Follow [these instructions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research/application-info) to apply!
